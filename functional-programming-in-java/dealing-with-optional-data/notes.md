### Dealing with optional data

- Java standard library contains methods & constructors taking optional parameters that must be set to `null` if they're unused
- `business null` - null reference is a valid argument
- never use a reference before checking if it is not null
- never get a value from a map without first testing whether the map contains the corresponding key
- accessing a list: check if it is not empty and it has enough element when accessing via index
- NullPointerException -> indiactor of a bug
